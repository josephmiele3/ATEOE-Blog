<h1>&nbspBook 1, Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>Pugilist</h2>
<p> I raise my arms to absorb the blow, feet skidding in the dirt as I'm knocked back a few feet. The man in front of me laughs as I stumble on the uneven ground. He steps forward again and I step backward, holding up a hand to warn him off.
<br>"You've got some fight left in you yet."<br> I can see from the corner of my eye that he's grinning. His hair is a shade darker than mine, and he's much bulkier. His face is marred by scars, the result of a lifetime of fighting. I'm outmatched. <br>
The other boy comes at me then, stepping into my reach as I spin on one foot, bringing my right heel across his face. I feel it connect as his nose breaks with an audible crack. We're both panting hard now, and when we meet again the only thing separating us is the gap between our fists.<br>
I swing, but he blocks easily with a forearm. He pushes himself away from the wall of the ring, his arm coming around to strike my upper arm. I dodge, turning my body to avoid the punch. Using the motion of my pivot, I grab his arm and pull, throwing my knee into his stomach. I turn and hit him again, kicking at his legs with as much force as I can muster. His knees buckle under the force of the attack and he falls forward onto his hands and elbows.<br>
My breath comes harshly; blood pounding in my ears. Some of my teeth feel loose in my mouth. I wait, hoping against all odds that the man's given up.<br>
No such luck. He staggers to his feet and he doesn't look good at all.  Blood trickles down from both nostrils, his lip has split open slightly and there's a bruise forming where I kicked him. The look he gives me tells me he'll have a black eye by morning, if not worse. A glimmering possibility sparks in the pit of my stomach; am I going to lose again? He's taken the best I've got and he's still standing.<br>
He lunges at me with a shout and swings his fists wildly, hitting me square in the face once more. It stings like hell, but I manage to deflect the next blow. When I swing back with a blow of my own, he ducks the punch without effort. He kicks out at my ankle and I fall, landing hard on the ground. The man looks down at me, eyes cold and hard. He kicks once, hard, and I fall. I try to struggle to my feet and fail, falling back to the hard dirt beneath us.<br>
The whistle blows, signaling the end of the match. My heart is racing, adrenaline still pumping through my veins. The pain is starting to set in, throbbing sharply in time with my breathing.<br>
I struggle to stand. The crowd jeers, laughing at me, and the referee calls another name, this time to the opposite end of the field. Another guy steps forward to take my place. I grit my teeth, and get to my feet slowly. I can hear a few people whispering my name, mocking me.<br><br>
Another match, another defeat.</p>
